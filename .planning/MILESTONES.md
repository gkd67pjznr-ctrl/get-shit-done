# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-24)

**Delivered:** Quality enforcement framework that makes Claude's executor behave like a senior engineer — checks the codebase, reads the docs, writes tests, reviews its own diffs — enforced by protocol, gated by config.

**Phases:** 4 phases, 8 plans
**Files modified:** 31 (+4,423 / -77)
**Timeline:** 1 day (2026-02-23 → 2026-02-24)
**Git range:** feat(01-01) → feat(04-01)
**Requirements:** 23/23 satisfied

**Key accomplishments:**
1. Fixed `is_last_phase` routing bug — multi-phase milestones route correctly via filesystem scan
2. Established quality config infrastructure — `quality.level` (fast/standard/strict) with fast as zero-change default
3. Added Quality Sentinel to executor — pre-task codebase scan, Context7 library lookup, mandatory tests, post-task diff review
4. Added Step 7b quality dimensions to verifier — duplication detection, orphaned exports, missing test files
5. Added `quality_scan` directives to planner — task actions specify code to reuse, docs to consult, tests to write
6. Wired Plan→Execute→Verify loop end-to-end — executor consumes planner quality_scan directives

**Tech Debt (4 low/info items):**
- SUMMARY.md frontmatter lacks `requirements-completed` field in all 8 plan summaries
- CFG-04 traceability row shows Phase 1 only; Phase 4 closure not back-filled
- execute_tasks sentinel references omit parenthetical step numbers (cosmetic)
- context7_protocol fast mode encoded as skip condition rather than named heading (cosmetic)
