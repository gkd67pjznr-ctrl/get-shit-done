# Project State -- Milestone v5.0

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Claude writes code like a senior engineer who always checks the codebase first, always reads the docs, always writes tests, and never takes shortcuts -- enforced by the framework, not dependent on ad-hoc prompting.
**Current focus:** Phase 19 - Dashboard UI

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 20 requirements across 5 categories (REG, SRV, UI, TERM, PAT)
- [Research]: tmux CLI via child_process replaces node-pty; chokidar@4 replaces fs.watch; ws for WebSocket
- [Research]: Single multiplexed SSE connection per client to avoid HTTP/1.1 6-connection limit

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- tmux CLI as terminal backend (Phase 21) may need prototype spike -- escape sequence handling unproven
- Project-to-tmux-session mapping heuristics need design in Phase 20

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-08
Stopped at: Phase 18-01 complete. server.cjs implemented, chokidar@4 installed, 8 tests pass.
Resume file: None
Next step: `/gsd:plan-phase 19` -- plan the Dashboard UI phase
